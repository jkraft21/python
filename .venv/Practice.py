#Basic Python Practice

#Define a Variable
variable = 100
print(variable)

#How to Call Variable Type
type(variable)

#Following are the Major Variable Types
Company = 'Apple'
type(Company)

Revenue = 590.25
type(Revenue)

Employees = 15000
type(Employees)

Pays_Dividend = True
type(Pays_Dividend)

# Get User Input
name = input()
print(name)

# Lists
#Use Brackets [] to Define Lists
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
len(colors)

# Dictionaries
#Use Braces {} to Define Dictionaries
investor_assets = {"Equity": 5000, "Fixed Income": 1000, "Derivatives": 300}

# Concatenate Strings
first_name = Justin
last_name = Kraft
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

# Split Strings
# The output from the .split() method is a list which is denoted by square bracket - []
welcome_message = "Hello & Welcome to Python Programming Fundamentals Course!"
welcome_message
words = welcome_message.split()
print(words)

# Comparison Operators
# "True" output means condition is satisfied
# "False" output means condition is not satisfied (condition is not true)

# range
# range() generates a list of numbers that are used to iterate over "For" loops
# The last integer generated by range() is up to, but not including, the last element
# Example: range(0, 4) generates integers from 0 up to, but not including, 4
